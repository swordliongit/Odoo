**Notes:**
If we add a new translation, it won't translate the custom fields. So we have to modify the i18n file.


1. Translations -> Export Translation -> select the module, select PO and export it.
2. Put the PO file under the module/i18n/ folder.
3. Edit the file and write your translations in the msgstr field, save and update/upgrade your module.
4. Go to Translations -> select your language -> Update
